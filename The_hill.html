Therer once was a big body.
he liked to make a sanwich for lunch.
But one day, he ran out of bread!
"Oh-no!", he kept saying to himslef.
but then he went to the store, and found out therer was no more bread in the world!
he was very sad, and he pouted for so long that he truned into a hill! 
the hill we are sitting on is that man.
